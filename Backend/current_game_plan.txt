1. Figure out the venv sutuation

2. Look at the Pinecone Doc ( Langchain ) and Embedding docs 

3. Once that is set up start try with txt context given to the model and see if it works in Embedding

4. Set up a pinecone embedding search ( semantic maybe ) and then use LLM to frame the output well 

5. Test with prompt and see if basic chatbot works 

6. Now add the tevus layer ( read docs and working of it ) and mostly load output to the model and see the 3d figure respond based on what you feed it ?

7. Buid Frontend with Claude and streamlit/React and make it talk to the Backend 

8. Deploy both sides of it using Heroku ( check ? ) and Vercel ( FE ? ) Check 

Notes:
- 
- Libraries installed in a venv -> source .venv/bin/activate ( use and download external libraries in this)
- deactivate to set back to normal
